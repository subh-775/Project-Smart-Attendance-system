<h2>Here's how it works :</h2>
<h3>
<u>Image Capture</u>: The system uses camera to take input and matches it with available databases.<br>
  
<u>Face Recognition</u>: Deep learning algorithms analyze these images to identify and verify the identities of the people present. The system compares the captured faces with a database of known individuals.<br>

<u>Attendance Tracking</u>: When a recognized face is detected, the system records the attendance. It can create a log or store the data in a spreadsheet.<br>

<u>Real-Time Processing</u>: The entire process happens in real time, allowing for efficient and accurate attendance management.<br>
