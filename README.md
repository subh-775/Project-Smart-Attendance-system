<h2>Our project in on Smart Attendance system using Face_recognition module in python.Hereâ€™s how it works:</h2>
<p><h3>
<u>Image Capture</u>: The system uses camera to take input and matches it with available databases.
<u>Face Recognition</u>: Deep learning algorithms analyze these images to identify and verify the identities of the people present. The system compares the captured faces with a database of known individuals.
<u>Attendance Tracking</u>: When a recognized face is detected, the system records the attendance. It can create a log or store the data in a spreadsheet.
<u>Real-Time Processing</u>: The entire process happens in real time, allowing for efficient and accurate attendance management.
