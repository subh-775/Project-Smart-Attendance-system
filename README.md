  <head><h1>Smart Attendance system using Face_recognition and Open cv</h1></head>
<body>
  
<h2>Here's how it works :</h2>
<h3><p>
<h4>Image Capture</h4>: The system uses camera to take input and matches it with available databases.<br><h4>Face Recognition</h4>: Deep learning algorithms analyze these images to identify and verify the identities of the people present. The system compares the captured faces with a database of known individuals.<br><h4>Attendance Tracking</h4>: When a recognized face is detected, the system records the attendance. It can create a log or store the data in a spreadsheet.<br><h4>Real-Time Processing</h4>: The entire process happens in real time, allowing for efficient and accurate attendance management.<br>
</h3>
